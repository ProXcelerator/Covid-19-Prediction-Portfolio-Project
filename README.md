# Lung Prediction Project

### Project Scope:
In this project we are looking at images of x-ray scans of 3 different lung types(Normal, Covid, and Pneunomia).   
I will perform a CNN to see if I can make accurate predictions on the test set of images. 

### Project Steps:
- Import librarys 
- Seperate the training data and test data
- build the CNN model 
- Set up the metrics and optimizations 
- Train the model 
- Test the model
